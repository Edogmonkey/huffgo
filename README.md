# huffgo

An implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm in Go.

It is entirely pointless because:
1. There is already an huffman decoder in the Go stl in the bzip2 package
2. More importantly, there are much faster implementation written in C that can be accessed through cgo bindings

This only exists because I am trying to teach myself Go and this seemed fun.
